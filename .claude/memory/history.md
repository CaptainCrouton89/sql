## 2025-10-12: diagnosed and resolved MCP server startup failure

- identified missing build directory causing MODULE_NOT_FOUND error
- ran pnpm run build to compile TypeScript and generate dist/ directory
- verified MCP server starts successfully with 17 tools enabled in HTTP mode

## 2025-10-12: tested sql execution tool after cli restart

- attempted to test mcp__sql__execute-sql tool
  - tool not available yet - user may need to run install-mcp and restart cli

## 2025-10-12: implemented HTTP-based SQL execution as firewall-friendly alternative

- added HTTP mode using Supabase REST API to bypass port 5432 firewall restrictions
  - created src/utils/http-database.ts for HTTP-based SQL execution via /rest/v1/rpc/execute_sql
  - added CONNECTION_MODE environment variable (defaults to 'http')
  - implemented fallback to direct postgres connection when CONNECTION_MODE=postgres
- updated database connection logic in src/utils/database.ts
  - added connection mode detection and validation
  - implemented executeQuery() function that routes to HTTP or postgres based on mode
  - enhanced error handling for both connection modes
- modified database tools in src/tools/database.ts to use new executeQuery abstraction
  - updated execute-sql, list-tables, describe-table, describe-functions tools
  - tools now work transparently with both HTTP and postgres modes
- updated configuration and documentation
  - updated CLAUDE.md with connection modes explanation and setup instructions
  - updated README.md with HTTP mode setup guidance
  - created HTTP_MODE_SETUP.md with detailed HTTP mode configuration
  - added migrations/001_execute_sql_function.sql for HTTP mode setup
- enhanced server initialization in src/index.ts
  - added connection mode validation on startup
  - improved environment variable handling
  - added ENABLED_TOOLS filtering capability

## 2025-10-12: Investigated alternative Supabase connection methods to avoid direct Postgres port 5432

- User requested alternative to direct Postgres connection due to port 5432 being frequently blocked
  - Proposed using Supabase service key and secret key for admin-level SQL execution
  - Goal: Execute SQL without requiring direct server connection to port 5432
- Modified src/utils/database.ts with 111 line changes
  - Likely added HTTP-based Supabase client implementation
  - Added admin authentication using service/secret keys
- Updated src/tools/database.ts with 32 line changes
  - Modified database tools to use new connection method
- Updated src/index.ts with 34 line changes
  - Integrated new Supabase HTTP connection approach
- Updated README.md with 19 line additions
  - Documented new connection method and configuration
- Created new file src/utils/http-database.ts
  - Implemented HTTP-based database utilities for Supabase

## 2025-10-12: enhanced database connection and configuration management

- refactored database connection logic in src/utils/database.ts
  - added 111 lines of enhanced database utility functions
  - improved connection handling and error management
- updated database tools in src/tools/database.ts
  - modified 32 lines to integrate new database utilities
  - improved tool implementation consistency
- enhanced MCP server implementation in src/index.ts
  - restructured 34 lines for better configuration handling
  - improved database tool registration
